    <h1>Lecture: Arrays</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Let's start with a quick exercise. Can you write a bit of code
      that does the following:
      <ul>
	<li>define three variables (let's call them <code>a1</code>, <code>a2</code> and <code>a3</code>)</li>
	<li>assign each variable an arbitrary numeric value</li>
	<li>create a fourth variable called <code>average</code></li>
	<li>calculate the average the of first 3 variables and assign it to <code>average</code></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now expand that so instead of calculating the average of three
      variable values, add two more variables and calculate the
      average of all five.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, what if you wanted to calculate the average of 100 values,
      or 1000? Changing your code to implement each of these changes
      would be a big hassle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Or what if you wanted to prompt the user for a number, and then
      average together that many values? Using variables in the way
      that we have been doing so far, there is no way to do this! You
      cannot declare a dynamic number of variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking about how to implement the above situations, it's
      almost like you need a loop. Remember, loops are used for
      repetition: to create code that does something many many times,
      or to create code that does something a some number of times
      that isn't specified until you get input from the user or
      elsewhere. We've written loops to print things to the
      console. But how could you write a loop to add up a bunch of
      variables
      like <code>a1</code>, <code>a2</code>, <code>a3</code>, etc
      above? For this, you need an array.
    </p>
      
    <h2>What is an array?</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are lists. An array is a single variable that contains a
      list of values. In JavaScript, an array is a <b>data
      structure</b> that contains an <b>ordered collection</b>
      of <b>elements</b>. Unlike variables, where each value has a
      unique name, with arrays, each value is <em>numbered</em>
      starting at <code>0</code>. The number that you use to reference
      which item in the list you want is called the <b>index</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember how variables were like labeled boxes? Imagine if we lined up a bunch of boxes next to each other, and now we can use how far they are from the "first" box (let's assume the first box is the one on the far left) as their label. An array is a <b>numbered list of variables</b>.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// this is an empty array
var myFirstArray = []
// this array is created with 8 elements
var anArrayWithNumbersInIt = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
// this one, with 5
var anArrayWithStringsInIt = ["pizza", "bagel", "pho", "bao", "curry"]
// and so forth
var anArrayWithRandomStuff = ["generally", 100, "don't", 200, "do", 300, "this"]</code></pre>

    <p>
      You can use <code>console.log(myArray)</code> to inspect the contents of an array.
      Don't be afraid to log anything and everything to better understand what's going on
      in your code.
    </p>

    <p>
      To read data from an array we use square brackets <code>[
      ]</code> to get a specific value from the list at the given
      index:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>var anArrayWithNumbersInIt = [ 11, 121, 1331 ];
console.log("first element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[0])
console.log("second element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[1])
console.log("third element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[2])
console.log("21st element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[20]) // what happens?</code></pre>

    <p>
      To write data to an array, we use the same syntax but include the <code>=</code> assignment operator we learned earlier.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>anArrayWithNumbersInIt[0] = -1
anArrayWithNumbersInIt[1] = -2
anArrayWithNumbersInIt[2] = -3

// what do you expect the output to be below?
console.log( anArrayWithNumbersInIt ); 

anArrayWithNumbersInIt[20] = -21 // What happens here?</code></pre>

    <p>
      It's good to understand what happens in weird cases like the last line above, however you should almost <b>never</b> do that, and when you do it is often a bug.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Methods and Properties of Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are a part of a more complex variable type in JavaScript, called <b>objects</b>. We won't go over objects too much here, but it's important to know that objects have methods and properties that can be accessed via the <code>.</code> operator.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use methods and properties to interact with the object and get data out of the object. We will learn more about JavaScript objects in the Access Code program, for this workshop the only objects we will discuss are Arrays and Functions.
    </p>

    <h3>Array Properties</h3>
    <p>A property of an object (in this case our array) is a <b>value</b> (just like the other variables we've discussed so far). Arrays only have one property, <b>.length</b>.</p>

    <pre><code>var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
console.log("The length of fruits is " + fruits.length)  // 4

// skipping letter trains because there are a lot...
var nycTrains = [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7" ];
console.log("The length of nycTrains is " + nycTrains.length)  // 7
</code></pre>

    <h3>Array Methods</h3>
    
    <p>
      A method of an object (in this case our array) is some <b>code</b> that performs a bunch of operations (similar to our company revenue calculator from the <a href="activity-variables.html">Variables</a> activity). 
    </p>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, you can tell an entity is a method if it comes after an array variable with a <code>.</code> and followed immediately by <code>()</code>. For example: <code>fruits.pop()</code>
    </p>

    <pre><code>// Can you guess what the following method does?
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
fruits.push("Papaya")
console.log("The length of fruits is " + fruits.length)  // 5
console.log( fruits ); // what do you expect to see in this array now?
</code></pre>


    <p>
      You can find a great tutorial (including some advanced topics about Objects that we won't cover in this workshop) <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">here at w3schools</a>. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp">array reference documentation at w3schools</a> is extremely helpful as well. Go there to look up the different methods and properties on arrays. Note the only useful property is <code>length</code>, but it's a very important one!
