    <h1>Lecture: Arrays</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Consider the following program that gives a play-by-play for an imaginary horse race:
      <pre><code>console.clear();

var horse1 = 0;
var horse2 = 0;
var horse3 = 0;

while ( horse1 < 2000 && horse2 < 2000 && horse3 < 2000 ) {
  console.log("Horse One is at " + horse1 + " meters.");
  console.log("Horse Two is at " + horse2 + " meters.");
  console.log("Horse Three is at " + horse3 + " meters.");

  horse1 = horse1 + Math.round(Math.random()*200);
  horse2 = horse2 + Math.round(Math.random()*200);
  horse3 = horse3 + Math.round(Math.random()*200);
}
console.log("We have a winner!");
</code></pre>

      We have three variables, one representing each horse. The <code>random()</code> lines increment each horse variable by some random distance between 0 and 200. (Don't worry about the details of this for now.) And the three <code>log()</code> commands each display the horses' progress. The <code>while</code> loop repeats until one horse gets to 2000 meters. Try copy/pasting that into CodePen and run to see the result.
    </p>

    <p>
      How would you expand this example if you wanted 5 horses? What if you wanted 10? Changing your code to implement each of these changes would be a pain. And what if you wanted a <em>dynamic</em> number of horses that was different each time your code ran? Using variables like we have been, there is no way to do this. To have a dynamic number of horses, you would need a way to have a dynamic number of variables. And for this, you need arrays.
    </p>
      
    
    <h2>What is an array?</h2>
    <p>
      An array is a single variable that can contain a list of values. In JavaScript, an array is a <b>data structure</b> that contains an <b>ordered collection</b> of <b>elements</b>. Each element is numbered starting at <code>0</code>, this is called the <b>index</b>.
    </p>

    </div>
    
    <p>
      Remember how variables were like labeled boxes? Imagine if we lined up a bunch of boxes next to each other, and now we can use how far they are from the "first" box (let's assume the first box is the one on the far left) as their label. An array is a <b>numbered list of variables</b>.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// this is an empty array
var myFirstArray = []
// this array is created with 8 elements
var anArrayWithNumbersInIt = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
// this one, with 5
var anArrayWithStringsInIt = ["pizza", "bagel", "pho", "bao", "curry"]
// and so forth
var anArrayWithRandomStuff = ["generally", 100, "don't", 200, "do", 300, "this"]</code></pre>

    <p>
      You can use <code>console.log(myArray)</code> to inspect the contents of an array.
      Don't be afraid to log anything and everything to better understand what's going on
      in your code.
    </p>

    <p>
      To read data from an array we use the square bracket syntax: <code>array[index]</code> to get a value out of an array at the given index.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>var anArrayWithNumbersInIt = [ 11, 121, 1331 ];
console.log("first element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[0])
console.log("second element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[1])
console.log("third element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[2])
console.log("21st element: " + anArrayWithNumbersInIt[20]) // what happens?</code></pre>

    <p>
      To write data to an array, we use the same syntax but include the <code>=</code> assignment operator we learned earlier.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>anArrayWithNumbersInIt[0] = -1
anArrayWithNumbersInIt[1] = -2
anArrayWithNumbersInIt[2] = -3

// what do you expect the output to be below?
console.log( anArrayWithNumbersInIt ); 

anArrayWithNumbersInIt[20] = -21 // What happens here?</code></pre>

    <p>
      It's good to understand what happens in weird cases like the last line above, however you should almost <b>never</b> do that, and when you do it is often a bug.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Methods and Properties of Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are a part of a more complex variable type in JavaScript, called <b>objects</b>. We won't go over objects too much here, but it's important to know that objects have methods and properties that can be accessed via the <code>.</code> operator.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use methods and properties to interact with the object and get data out of the object. We will learn more about JavaScript objects in the Access Code program, for this workshop the only objects we will discuss are Arrays and Functions.
    </p>

    <h3>Array Properties</h3>
    <p>A property of an object (in this case our array) is a <b>value</b> (just like the other variables we've discussed so far). Arrays only have one property, <b>.length</b>.</p>

    <pre><code>var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
console.log("The length of fruits is " + fruits.length)  // 4

// skipping letter trains because there are a lot...
var nycTrains = [ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7" ];
console.log("The length of nycTrains is " + nycTrains.length)  // 7
</code></pre>

    <h3>Array Methods</h3>
    
    <p>
      A method of an object (in this case our array) is some <b>code</b> that performs a bunch of operations (similar to our company revenue calculator from the <a href="activity-variables.html">Variables</a> activity). 
    </p>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, you can tell an entity is a method if it comes after an array variable with a <code>.</code> and followed immediately by <code>()</code>. For example: <code>fruits.pop()</code>
    </p>

    <pre><code>// Can you guess what the following method does?
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
fruits.push("Papaya")
console.log("The length of fruits is " + fruits.length)  // 5
console.log( fruits ); // what do you expect to see in this array now?
</code></pre>


    <p>
      You can find a great tutorial (including some advanced topics about Objects that we won't cover in this workshop) <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">here at w3schools</a>. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp">array reference documentation at w3schools</a> is extremely helpful as well. Go there to look up the different methods and properties on arrays. Note the only useful property is <code>length</code>, but it's a very important one!
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    
    <p>
      Returning again to the example that we started with, the following code uses an array called <code>horses</code> to generate a dynamic number of horses each time you run, and uses a <code>while</codE> loop to iterate over those horses to increment and print the position of each.

<pre><code>var horses = [];

var numberOfHorses = Math.floor( Math.random()*10 );
var i = 0;
while ( i < numberOfHorses ) {
  horses[i] = 0;
  i = i + 1;
}

var winner = false;
while ( !winner ) {
  
  i = 0;
  while ( i < horses.length ) {
    console.log("Horse " + i + " is at " + horses[i] + " meters.");
    
    horses[i] = horses[i] + Math.random()*200;
    if ( horses[i] > 2000 ) {
      winner = true;
    }
    i = i + 1;
  }
}
console.log("We have a winner!");
</code></pre>
