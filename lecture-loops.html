    <h1>Lecture: Loops</h1>
    
    <p>
      Imagine if we wanted to write to the console all the even
      numbers between 0 and 100. Or even just repeat the same thing --
      like "text my mom something nice" or "text my ex something mean"
      -- many times?
    </p>

    <p>
      We could simply copy/paste many <code>console.log</code> commands:
    <pre><code>console.log(1)
console.log(2)
console.log(3)
console.log(4)
console.log(5)
console.log(6)
console.log(7)
console.log(8)
console.log(9)
console.log(10)
console.log(11)
console.log(12)
console.log(13)
console.log(14)
console.log(15)
// etc ...</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      But that looks pretty tedious! What if we wanted to do this 100,
      or 1,000, or 1,000,000 times?! That would be a lot of copy/pasting.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we wanted to prompt the user to input a number, and
      print something that many times? There is no way we could do
      this simply by copy/pasting!
    </p>

    <p>
      Computers are not very smart, but they are <i>very</i> good at
      doing repetetive tasks. How? They use <b>loops</b>! Many
      algorithms depend on this type of behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loops use several things that we have already talked about
      (variables, arithmetic and conditionals) and put them together
      with a new <code>while</code> keyword to instruct the computer
      how to do repetive tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
<pre><code>var i = 0
while ( i < 100 ) {
  console.log(i)
  i = i + 1
}
</code></pre>

Read this as "Set <code>i</code> to 0. While <code>i</code> is less than 100, print <code>i</code> to the console and increase <code>i</code> by one."
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So what's going on here? Let's break it down:
    </p>

    <p>
      The loop has four major sections:
      <ol>
        <li>Initialization: <code>var i = 0</code></li>
        <li>Condition: <code>i < 100</code></li>
        <li>Body:
<pre style="margin: 7px 10px;"><code>console.log(i)
i = i + 1</code></pre></li>
        <li>This last line has a special purpose so we give it a special name: the Increment.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      In each of these four sections, you can put in any values that
      you need to achieve the kind of repetition that you are trying
      to implement. (Or you can put in nothing at all! but the vast
      majority of the time all four sections have something in them.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you might create a loop that never completes. This
      happens when the condition is never met. We call this an
      "infinite loop." (Now do you get the joke
      of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apple+Store,+Infinite+Loop/@37.3314187,-122.0304089,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb651414deb31e9fb!8m2!3d37.3314187!4d-122.0304089">the
      address of Apple's Headquarters</a> in Cupertino, CA?) There are
      some occasions where you might want this, but for now it is
      a <em>bad thing</em>. For example, if you forget to include an
      Increment, your looping variable will never increase, your
      stopping condition will never be met, and your page will
      hang. Let's try this once to see what happens and how to get out
      of it. [WARNING: save your work first!] Now in general: be
      careful not to do this!
    </p>

    <h2>Initialization</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>initialization</b> is where you set up the variables that you need for your loop. The most common is <code>var i = 0;</code> but you can start at anything, for example: <code>1</code> or <code>1000000</code>, depending on what your program is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the following loop will print each year since the invention of the World Wide Web.
<pre><code>var i = 1989;
while ( i < 2017 ) {
  console.log(i);
  i = i + 1;
}
</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Challenge Question:</b> Try changing the variable initialization so that the code prints each year since you were born.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Condition</h2>
    <p>
      A loop will execute the statements in the <b>body</b> repeatedly until the <b>condition</b> evaluates to <code>false</code>. Each execution of the body is called an <b>iteration</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Challenge Question:</b> Try changing the above example so that no matter what the initial variable value is, the code prints the next 10 years. <br/>
      <em>Hint 1: You can use basic variable arithmetic in the condition statement.</em> <br/>
      <em>Hint 2: Be careful to avoid an <b>infinite loop</b> here!
      You might need to introduce a 2nd variable to make this
      work.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Increment</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>increment</b> is where you update the variables at the end of each iteration. The most common is <code>i = i + 1</codE> (or <code>i++</code>) but you can do anything, for example: <code>i += 2</code> or <code>i *= 2</code>, depending on what your program is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following loop prints all even numbers between 10 and 20.
<pre><code>var i = 10;
while ( i < 20 ) {
  console.log(i);
  i = i + 2;
}
</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Challenge Question:</b> Try changing the above example so
      that it prints all the years since you've been born but in
      reverse order, starting with this year first and going back in
      time. <br/>
      <em>Hint: the "increment" can actually decrease the
      variable value.</em>
    </p>
        
    <h2>Body</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>body</b> is the meat of your loop. The rest is just figuring out where you start, where you end, and what the step size is. The body gets executed over and over again until the condition evaluates to <code>false</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>body</b> of a loop can include <em>any</em> valid JavaScript statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Challenge Question:</b> Try modifying the example that prints
      each year since you've been born, but also prints "Can't vote"
      or "Can vote!" depending on whether you were at least 18 that
      year. <br/>
      <em>Hint: <a href="lecture-conditionals.html">Conditionals</a>
      are perfectly valid in the body of a loop.</em>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Syntactic Sugar</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to the way that English allows multiple ways to say the same thing, most programming languages have syntax rules that allow you to write the same instructions in different ways. One example of this is the way you can write the Initialization, Condition and Increment of a <code>while</code> loop in one compact line with a bit of equivalent syntax called a <code>for</code> loop. The following two code snippets are exactly equivalent:
<pre><code>var i = 0;
while ( i < 100 ) {
    console.log(i);
    i = i + 1;
  }
</code></pre>
and
<pre><code>for ( var i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1 ) {
    console.log(i);
  }
</code></pre>
Most experienced programmers tend to write loops using the <code>for</code> structure, but if you find <code>while</code> loops to be more easily readable, feel free to use which ever you like!
